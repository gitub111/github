                                        <P>The history of education in England is documented from Saxon settlement of England, and the setting up of the first cathedral schools in 597 and 604.

                                            Education in England remained closely linked to religious institutions until the nineteenth century, although charity schools and "free grammar schools", which were open to children of any religious beliefs, became more common in the early modern period. Nineteenth century reforms expanded education provision and introduced widespread state-funded schools. By the 1880s education was compulsory for children aged 5 to 10, with the school leaving age progressively raised since then, most recently to 18 in 2015.
                                            
                                            The education system was expanded and reorganised multiple times throughout the 20th century, with a Tripartite System introduced in the 1940s, splitting secondary education into grammar schools, secondary technical schools and secondary modern schools. In the 1960s this began to be phased out in favour of comprehensive schools. Further reforms in the 1980s introduced the National Curriculum and allowed parents to choose which school their children went to. Academies were introduced in the 2000s and became the main type of secondary school in the 2010s.[1]
                                            
                                            Scotland has a separate system; see History of education in Scotland, much of the information listed below is relevant to Wales but specific information on the development of Education in Wales can be found</P>

                                        <h3>our teaching department</h3>
                                        <p>Nestled amongst the foliage of erect trees and plants pruned through years of care, the Institute of English Studies is located in the developed part of Lahore. The Institute houses a quiet space among greenery spread on its either side where nature seems to offer a spur for creative and literary pursuits.
                                            The University of the Punjab has been examining candidates in its affiliated colleges in MA and BA (Hons) since 1882. The teaching Department of English Language and Literature was established in 1963. Professor Siraj-ud-Din was the first Head of the Department. Since then, the department has staffed academics with strong educational and research profiles. The teaching strength ranges from Greeks to Shakespearean Studies, Victorian to Post-modern and Contemporary Critical Theory. It is currently offering BS, MA, MPhil and PhD programmes including diplomas in ELT, Linguistics and Spoken English. The graduates from this department serve the nation in different capacities. The scholars produced here get international acclaim by presenting their research at various forums.
                                            Prof. Dr. Amra Raza is the Director of Institute of English Studies and Dean, Faculty of Arts & Humanities.
